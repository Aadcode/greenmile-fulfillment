### 2. Code Compilation
- Fixed TypeScript errors in service implementation
- Compiled TypeScript files to JavaScript
- Generated TypeScript declaration (.d.ts) files for better type support

### 3. Package Build and Installation
- Built the package as a tarball (medusa-greenmile-fulfillment-1.0.0.tgz)
- Installed the package in the main Medusa project

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Environment Variables**: Add any necessary environment variables to your project (e.g., GREENMILE_API_URL)

2. **Test the Integration**: Start your Medusa server and verify that the Greenmile fulfillment provider is working correctly

3. **Publish the Package** (Optional): If you want to share this package with your team or the community, you can publish it to npm using the command `npm publish` (ensure you're logged in to npm first)

## Usage

The Greenmile fulfillment provider can now be used in your Medusa store to:

- Calculate shipping rates for different service levels (standard, express, same-day, next-day)
